Third Project with The Odin Project

Objective: Create a browser version on an Etch-a-Sketch.

Goals:
1. Make a webpage containing a 16x16 grid.
2. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change colour when the mouse passes over them.
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking how many squares to make the new grid.
4. (OPTIONAL) Generate a random colour whenever the mouse passes over the grid.
